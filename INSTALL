             rrpm Installation

rrpm is written in Java. You'll need Java JDK 1.6 and Apache Maven
(http://maven.apache.org/) to build it. Once you have the source, run

   mvn install assembly:single

from the source directory, and it will build everything you need. This
will build the following packages:

   target/rrpm-1.2-dist.tar.gz
   target/rpm/rrpm/RPMS/noarch/rrpm-1.2-1.noarch.rpm

You can either install the RPM package, or untar the tarball.

Installing the RPM package:

Run

   rpm -i rrpm-1.2-1.noarch.rpm

It will install rrpm under /usr/share/rrpm-1.2, and create a symlink
under /usr/bin to the rrpm binary.

Installing the tarball:

Run

   tar xfz rrpm-1.2-dist.tar.gz
